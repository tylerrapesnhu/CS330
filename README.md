Projects for the SNHU Class CS330

I was not able to upload my whole file, so I chose the source files as the best example of my code. 

This was the first course where I felt that I really had some hand in designing anything. 

In this class, I felt that design was more so thinking about the aesthetic of the picture we were trying to recreate than it was to design the software we were creating. I feel that this class helped me understand designing graphics, illuminating them, creating textures and so on. I can take the tactics and skills from this project and use them in future software that deals with visualization.

I approach developing programs logically. If we are starting with a program that is already somewhat written, I look at the code and how it is currently functioning. I then look at what is required to finish the project and come up with a game plan to incorporate those requirements into the software. This project specifically tested my skills and helped my brain dig deeper into understanding what wasn't working when I would run the program. I feel that this level of fact finding in the code will help me further my development in the future. 

Computer science is the field in which I want to work so each of the classes I have taken have helped further that goal. The skills in this class have given me further understanding of graphics visualization and how that is accomplished. In my furture professional pathway, I hope that these skills help me develop applications that can be successful and helpful to users.
